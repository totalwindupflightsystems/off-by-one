# Off-by-One — Task Board (Model-Router Matrix)

> **Core purpose:** Pre-solve lab that converts idle GPU time into pre-verified answers — submit problems, sandbox-solve them, discover solutions.
> **Language:** Go 1.26.5 | **Stack:** SQLite graph DB, Bubblewrap sandbox, Pi Agent solver, Muster MCP bridge
> **Foreman:** deepseek-v4-pro (planning) | **Worker:** MiniMax M3 via ollama-cloud
> **DuckBrain:** operational snapshots written per tick
> **Status:** ALL PHASES COMPLETE (32 tasks, 11/11 packages tested, 76.3% coverage). 0 stubs. 0 TODOs.
> **Last E2E:** PASS (tick 85) — Server OK (systemd active, 1h20m uptime, port 8766). All endpoints verified: /health ✅, /api/v1/stats ✅ (25 problems, 30 verified answers, hit_rate 1.0, coverage 1.2, queue_depth 0), POST /api/v1/problems/submit ✅ (sub_3758dd queued → solved), POST /api/v1/problems/discover ✅ (found=true — foreman-tick85-e2e solved by deepseek-v4-flash, answer verified). Build PASS, vet PASS, Hilo: 352 edges / 45 files. NEVER-DONE: ALL 11 checks PASS — SECURITY.md ✅, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ✅, CHANGELOG.md ✅, SUPPORT.md ✅, CONTRIBUTING.md ✅, LICENSE ✅, 0 TODOs, 0 stubs. CI: last 3 runs all success.

## Task Matrix

| ID | Task | Priority | Complexity | Deps | Tags | Model | Reasoning | Fallback |
|----|------|----------|------------|------|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| DS-007 | Continuous self-dogfood E2E (per tick) | High | 3 ± 1 | server running | +++terminal, ++testing, +api-use | deepseek-v4-pro | Low | MiniMax-M3 |
| U01 | Usability & coverage audit — find gaps in endpoint wiring, UX flow, error handling, edge cases, test coverage | High | 3±1 | — | +++testing, ++endpoint-verification, ++code-review, +e2e, -vision | DS-V4-Flash | Medium | GLM-5.2 |
| INFRA-001 | Host resource contention — Go builds fail with pthread_create (pthread 17/threads exhausted); investigate process limits and concurrent foreman load | Medium | 2±1 | — | +++terminal, ++infra, +performance | DS-V4-Flash | Low | GLM-5.2 |
| NEVER-DONE | 11-point audit sweep | Medium | 2 ± 1 | DS-007 results | +++terminal, +++file-editing, +documentation | deepseek-v4-pro | Medium | MiniMax-M3 |

## Completed (32/32 done)

All phases shipped: OpenAPI spec, SQLite graph engine, ingest queue, HTTP API server, Bubblewrap sandbox, Pi Agent solver, idle cron loop, Web UI (6 views + AI chat), git export/import, main binary wiring, FTS5 search, Muster MCP bridge + E2E verification, spec gap fixes, solver hardening, CI, docs, embeddings, file attachments, govulncheck.

## Assumptions

- DS-007 is recurring (runs every tick) — its priority stays HIGH because it validates the core pipeline
- NEVER-DONE runs after DS-007; if E2E fails, NEVER-DONE captures gaps as BUG tasks before audit
- Project is genuinely complete — idle audit finds only minor recurring gaps (all resolved as of tick 85)
- **Tick 85 milestone:** All recurring docs gaps (SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CHANGELOG.md, SUPPORT.md) resolved in prior commit. NEVER-DOWN 11-point sweep now clears all checks.

## Execution Order

1. DS-007 (every tick — submit → solve → discover → verify)
2. NEVER-DONE (after DS-007 — use E2E results in audit)

## Escalation Conditions

- DS-007 E2E fails (submit, solve, or discover returns unexpected) → create BUG task, escalate to foreman
- Audit finds spec drift → create SPEC task, assign GPT-5.6 Terra
- Audit finds test gap → create TEST task, assign Step 3.7 Flash
- Server not healthy (systemd dead, port not listening) → CRITICAL, escalate to foreman
- Solver broken (consecutive solve failures) → CRITICAL, escalate to foreman
